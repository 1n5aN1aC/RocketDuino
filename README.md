# RocketDuino
Arduino Board designed for use in High-Powered model rockets.

(Picture Goes Here)

##The Idea
The idea began when my friend started work on a High-Powered model rocket project, and I thought it would be awesome to have live telemetry back from the rocket, with altitude and GPS location to aid in recovery.

So....  I started working on a Custom PCB for it, and firmware / software to go along with it.

####Hardware
Currently, it works with any Serial GPS device that outputs standards-compliant NMEA messages, (GNS, GGA, GLL) and optionally a MS5611 Barometer for more accurate real-time elevation measurement.

Data Transmission is done with a LoRa 433/900 MHz trasmitter, but any data transmitter with a serial interface should work.

More information coming soon(ish)
