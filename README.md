# RocketDuino
Arduino Board designed for use in High-Powered model rockets.

(Picture Goes Here)

##The Idea
The idea was sparked from my friend working on a High-Powered model rocket project, and I thought it would be awesome to have live telemetry back from the rocket, with altitude and GPS location to aid in recovery.

So....  I started working on a Custom PCB for it, and software to go along with it.

Currently, it works with any Serial GPS device that outputs standards-compliant NMEA messages, (GNS, GGA, GLL) and a MS5611 Barometer for more accurate real-time elevation.

Data Transmission is with a LoRa 433/900 MHz trasmitter, but any data transmitters with a serial interface should work.

More information coming soon(ish)

##The Board
Eagle files & explaination coming soon!

##The Software
Coming soon!

##The Results
We haven't actually tested anything in the real world yet... :(
